            Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, OM, FRS, HonFRSE
            (30 August 1871 – 19 October 1937) was a New Zealand physicist who
            came to be known as the father of nuclear physics. Encyclopedia
            Britannica considers him to be the greatest experimentalist since
            Michael Faraday (1791–1867). Apart from his work in his homeland, he
            spent a substantial amount of his career abroad, in both Canada and
            the United Kingdom.

              <li>
