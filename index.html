        <p>
          Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, OM, FRS, HonFRSE
          (30 August 1871 – 19 October 1937) was a New Zealand physicist who
          came to be known as the father of nuclear physics. Encyclopædia
          Britannica considers him to be the greatest experimentalist since
          Michael Faraday (1791–1867). Apart from his work in his homeland, he
          spent a substantial amount of his career abroad, in both Canada and
          the United Kingdom.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The mass of the atom is concentrated in the center of the atom.
          </li>

            Rutherford model proposed that the negatively charged electrons
            surround the nucleus of an atom.

        <ul>
          <li>
            One of the drawbacks of the Rutherford model was also that he did
            not say anything about the arrangement of electrons in an atom which
            made his theory incomplete.
